        The purpose of this documentation is to **give you an overview** about what **snappify is capable of**. We want to explain all the different features so you're able to use the powerful functionalities in _no time_. ðŸ’ª
    </Box>

</Flex>

Snappify helps you to **better explain your code**, show off your latest features, or just beautify your day-to-day code snippets. Doesn't matter if you want to share it as an image, embed it in an iframe or share a public URL - snappify got you covered.

You're also able to manage all your snippets in **one Dashboard** to keep a better overview about your content.

With integrations like our **VS Code Extension** it enables you to create fancy code snippets directly from your IDE. We also cover how you can integrate the snappify Editor in **your own application!**

There is also an **API** which helps you to automate creating beautiful screenshots of your code and leverage **the power of snappify** in your own services.

As you can see snappify can be applied for **various use-cases**. Therefore we structured the documentation into four sections:

- **Dashboard** - gives you an overview how snappify helps you to organize your code snippets in one place
- **The Editor** - where we explain the ins and outs of our powerful design tool
- **Snappify API** - to show you how to automate the process of creating beautiful code screenshots
- **Integrations** - contains documentation about 3rd party integrations to boost your workflow
